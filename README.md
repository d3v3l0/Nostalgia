## How To Run

Nostalgia is (primarily) written in Scala. So to run the program, you need to have a Java Runtime Environment running on your machine. Detailed setup instructions will be provided soon.

## Engine + GUI

Nostalgia has two main parts, the **Engine** and the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

The engine contains the AI implementation and is divided into four sub-parts: _board representation_, _move generators_, _evaluators_, and _move searchers_. The GUI is the interface with which the user would interact while using the program.



## Technologies Used

**Programming Languages:** Scala, Java
